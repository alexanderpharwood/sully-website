                <h3>The build.json file</h3>
                <p>Every project contains a buid.json file. It's what tells the Sully compiler how to build the project.
                 Here is an example:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
{<br>
    "builds": {<br>
        "production": {<br>
            "output": "app/build/build.prod.js"<br>
        },<br>
        "development": {<br>
            "output": "app/build/build.dev.js"<br>
        }<br>
    },<br>
    "router": "app/router.js",<br>
    "controllers": {<br>
        "index": "app/controllers/indexController.js",<br>
        "error": "app/controllers/errorController.js"<br>
    },<br>
    "views": {<br>
        "header": "app/views/header.html",<br>
        "404": "app/views/404.html",<br>
        "403": "app/views/403.html",<br>
        "index": "app/views/index.html",<br>
    },<br>
    "middleware": {<br>
        "example": "app/middleware/ExampleMiddleware.js"<br>
    },<br>
    "serveIgnoreRoutePaths": [<br>
        "vendor",<br>
        "app",<br>
    ]<br>
}
</pre>
            <p>Within "builds" you should specify a location for the output of production and development builds.
             These are the locations that the "sully build" command, and the autobuilder, will compile to.
         The "router" element should contain the location of your router. The "controllers", "views", and "middleware"
         elements should contain a list of their respective parts. The key for each is the name (as used in your router).
     The "serveIgnoreRoutePaths" element should be a list of all paths you want "sully serve" to ignore, i.e, to not redirect
 to index.html. These might be directories containing static content.</p>
