                <h3>The CLI tool</h3>
                <p>The CLI tool provides an interface for creating new Sully projects and compiling builds.
                You can get it from npm:</p>
                <pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">$ npm i sully -g</pre>
                <p>Because the tool is only for creating and building projects, it's appropriate and more convenient to install it globally.</p>
                <p><b>Creating a new project</b></p>
                <pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">$ sully new &lt;project-name&gt; &lt;template&gt;</pre>
                <p>The new command will pull a project template and extract it and ensure you are all ready to go.
                We reccomend using "starter" (without the quotes) as your template; however, you can pop any url in here
                which points to a Sully template (zipped).</p>
                <p><b>Building a project</b></p>
                <pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">$ sully build</pre>
                <p>The build command will compile your controllers, middleware, views, and routes. It will build a development and a production
                version, which will both be written to your specified locations in build.json.</p>
                <p><b>The autobuilder</b></p>
                <pre class="prettyprint lang-bash">$ sully autobuild &lt;path&gt;</pre>
                <p>The autobuilder will listen for changes and perform automatic builds. The path parameter is option, and will
                tell the autobuilder to listen for changes only in the specified file or directory. If no path is specified, the autobuilder will
                listen for changes in all files.</p>
